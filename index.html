         <B>Relations:</B>
         <BR>
         <BR> In the following, substitute actual names for Relation1, Relation2 etc. Have entries for five relations in your project, ideally representing different aspects of the database. Clicking a link on a relation name should execute an SQL query and list 10-20 tuples in that particular relation (of course, they don't work below). Your output should be presented on a separate web page in a neat orderly fashion, one row for each tuple and where columns are evident. Ensure that all columns have their headers listed and their types are clear (i.e., state which is an int and which is a char and so on).

            <li><a href="recipes.php">Relation1: List the system administrators and the number of configuration items they administer.
               </a>
            <li><a href="http://cs4604.cs.vt.edu/~ysirui/hello.html">Relation2: It is often the case that a system administrator will need to schedule maintenance for a server. As part of the scheduling process, s/he will need to know what other systems might be impacted. For a given configuration item (named 'super-server'), list all dependent configuration items.</a>
            <li><a href="http://cs4604.cs.vt.edu/~ysirui/hello.html">Relation3: If an event occurs impacting the availability of a system, a system administrator will want to know what has changed both on that system and on other systems that support his/her system. For a given configuration item (named 'down-app'), list all configuration items that 'down-app' depends upon along with the last time they were changed and who the system administrator is for those configuration items.
               </a>
            <li><a href="http://cs4604.cs.vt.edu/~ysirui/hello.html">List configuration items by type.</a>

         <B>Queries:</B>
         <BR>
         <BR> In the following, substitute the english query description for a query to your database. You can use any query you like (including the ones we have given), <strong>as long as the query does not take more than 10
         seconds to execute</strong>. This constraint is to prevent overloading the database with expensive queries that run for minutes or hours. You can use the
         <kbd>LIMIT</kbd> keyword to list a small number of tuples, say 10-20, that satisfy the query. Again, clicking a link on the query name should execute the appropriate SQL query and list the tuples that are the answer to that particular query. Make sure your output is neatly ordered and column names and types are evident. The output should appear on a separate page.
